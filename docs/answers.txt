d) As noted in the recitation slides, one possible reason why		
branches are used in a Git repository is to break up development 
tasks among the team members. An example of this would be having 
a new branch for a new feature. Another reason why branches are used 
is that they are extremely useful when developers are working on 
the same project, in parallel. 
										
e) The command git log shows the commit logs, and provides information on the commits. 
For example, for each commit, it lists the commit ID, author, date, and message. The command git status
displays differences and the status of the working tree. This command shows the paths and files that are not tracked, 
or that are staged/unstaged for commits. Git status will also display if the local
branch is up to date.

h)	I) In object oriented programming, inheritance is the idea of deriving classes from another class.
This allows the existence of a class that uses an existing class, or parent class, and builds upon
that parent class. The child class would inherit properties from the parent class.
	II) Polymorphism occurs when there is inheritance already occuring. For example, a Shape class, with 
a child class called Circle, could have the following objects because of polymorphism:
	Circle c1 = new Circle();   
	Shape c2 = new Circle();
